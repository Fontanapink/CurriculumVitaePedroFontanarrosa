  abstract = {Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline in which biological components are assembled to form devices with user-defined functions. As in any engineering discipline, modeling is a big part of the design process, since it helps to predict, control, and debug systems in an efficient manner. Systems biology has always been concerned with dynamic models, and a recent increase in high-throughput of experimental data has made it essential to develop dynamic models that can be used for an iterative learning process in a design/build/test workflow. In this thesis work, an automated model generator is created to automatically generate dynamic models for genetic regulatory networks, implemented in the genetic design automation tool, iBioSim. This automated model generator uses parameters stored at an online parts repository and encodes the mathematical models it generates using Systems Biology Markup Language. The automated model generator is then used to model and simulate genetic circuits created with the design environment referred to as Cello. The simulation of the mathematical models produces a dynamical response prediction of each of the circuits, which is unavailable with steady-state modeling. Some of these dynamical responses present unexpected behavior. Using the dynamic models generated with the automatic model generator of this work, an analysis of the predicted behaviors yielded insight into the underlying biology phenomena that cause the observed glitching behavior of these circuits. The last chapter of this thesis is focused mainly on future enhancements to the automated model generator of this work to produce more accurate and precise models not only for genetic regulatory networks in Escherichia coli but any organism where parametrization exists as proposed in this thesis work. It also explores different analysis that could be implemented into the automated model generator of this work, in order to expand the assessment done on genetic circuits.},

The results shed light on the difference between the intrinsic and extrinsic noise model predictions and if the differences in circuit layouts have any effect on glitch propensities. This, in turn, emphasizes the need to evaluate further the relative influence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on a genetic circuit's output to help designers predict circuit failures more accurately and, therefore, determine better design choices. Moreover, the percent failure predictions between different circuit layouts can help designers weigh different options of circuit topologies to determine which one is best suited for the intended purposes of the design.},

  abstract = {The design-build-test-learn workflow is critical in synthetic biology, with recent efforts to automate most of these steps to open the field to a broader, diversely skilled community. Efforts to develop better models and parameter values can produce more accurate circuit output predictions.  However, the learn step (re-parameterizing characterized gates and model exploration) is still a very manual process that requires much expertise and skill. Therefore, attempts to obtain more detailed model predictions is usually dampened by this challenge.  As we move from proof-of-concept circuit designs to more real-life applications, a circuits' robustness to a changing environment and other noise factors that may induce circuit errors is of critical importance for the safe and controlled application of designed systems. However, how much more information do different models and parametrization efforts provide to design choices based on robustness?  This paper investigates robustness and predictability of genetic circuits in-silico for different models and levels of characterization. The work predicts robustness by evaluating the likelihood of unwanted switching variations in a genetic circuit's output both when changing states or initializing the circuit, its ability to hold its state, and its likelihood of failure. The circuit's predictability is analyzed by simulating the circuits response to intrinsic and extrinsic noise for different models, and using parameter values obtained from literature or from characterization experiments.},

  abstract = {Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline in which biological components are assembled to form devices with user-defined functions. As a nascent discipline, genetic circuit design is reserved only for experienced researchers with an in-depth knowledge of biology. This work aims to alleviate some of these constraints by developing software to facilitate genetic circuit design and analysis so that more researchers can participate in this thriving discipline and help elucidate the causes of circuit failures. Firstly, an automatic dynamic model generator can be implemented to predict a circuit's behavior between steady states and determine the amount of time needed to reach such steady states. Moreover, the analysis of the predicted dynamic behavior will help the designers understand the risks of applying specific input changes and decide whether the risk is critical for the designed systems' intended purposes. Extrinsic and intrinsic noise can contribute to the observed output variability of a clonal population. Therefore, to account for a genetic circuits' stochastic behavior, this work aims to develop stochastic modeling using extrinsic and intrinsic noise contributions that can help infer glitch probabilities and elucidate the causes of circuit failure. All the methodologies developed in this work will serve the overacting aim of redesigning genetic circuits to avoid circuit failures. Dynamic ODE modeling will predict glitching behavior and the time to reach said states; stochastic modeling will be used to predict glitch propensities; hazard-preserving transformations will be used to avoid solvable hazards. Facilitated dynamic modeling of genetic circuits would be an instrumental technique for synthetic biologists, especially if it can be accompanied by a circuit design automation tool, such as those proposed in this work. This would help automation in synthetic biology and provide a way to debug circuit designs before construction and compare predictions with experimental data once the synthesized circuit is implemented, saving time, effort, and money. This project aims to expand such capabilities to help researchers through the design process with the development of automated modeling, logic synthesis, hazard identification, and genetic circuit redesign.},

  abstract = {Systems biology is increasingly relying on computational tools for the modeling, editing, sharing, and analyzing of biological cell functions. Yet, this process often involves multiple tools and can be a tedious and manual process. This work presents SynBioSuite, a cloud-based tool for streamlining the process of modeling and analyzing biological functions. The utility of this tool will be demonstrated by constructing and analyzing a model of the phage lambda genetic switch.},

  abstract = {Over the past 2 decades, synthetic biology has yielded ever more complex genetic circuits that are able to perform sophisticated functions in response to specific signals. Yet, genetic circuits are not immediately transferable to an outside-the-lab setting where their performance is highly compromised. We propose introducing a broader test step to the design\textendash build\textendash test\textendash learn workflow to include factors that might contribute to unexpected genetic circuit performance. As a proof of concept, we have designed and evaluated a genetic circuit in various temperatures, inducer concentrations, nonsterilized soil exposure, and bacterial growth stages. We determined that the circuit's performance is dramatically altered when these factors differ from the optimal lab conditions. We observed significant changes in the time for signal detection as well as signal intensity when the genetic circuit was tested under nonoptimal lab conditions. As a learning effort, we then proceeded to generate model predictions in untested conditions, which is currently lacking in synthetic biology application design. Furthermore, broader test and learn steps uncovered a negative correlation between the time it takes for a gate to turn ON and the bacterial growth phases. As the synthetic biology discipline transitions from proof-of-concept genetic programs to appropriate and safe application implementations, more emphasis on test and learn steps (i.e., characterizing parts and circuits for a broad range of conditions) will provide missing insights on genetic circuit behavior outside the lab.},
